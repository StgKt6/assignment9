function convert temp use menu
COP 1000C Intro to Programming Concepts 
Assignment 9
Write the code using functions. Write a C program that gives user menu to choose from â€“ 
1. Convert temperature input from the user in degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius 
2. Convert temperature input from the user in degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit 
3. Quit. 
Formulae- C = (5 / 9) * (F-32) and F = (9/5) * C + 32 
Need to use functions only to accomplish 1 and 2. 
Need to use at least two functions for each scenario and need to call them from the main function. Can use more functions as you see fit. 
Test the program with the following values: 
68 degree F = 20 degree C 
20 degree C = 68 degree F 
-22 degree F = -30 degree C 
0 degree C = 32 degree F 
Deliverables: 
Paste your code and output from running the program in a word document, and attach it to your submission. Include all the code. 
You will earn a grade of zero if you do not demonstrate the use of functions to do this assignment. 
Include the output from running your program for four test cases to convince the reader that the program is functioning correctly.
 Rubric: 
1. Use of correctly functioning menu (10 points) 
2. Correct use of at least two functions for Scenario 1 (i.e. converting from F to C.) (25 points) 
3. Correct use of at least two functions for Scenario 2 (i.e. converting from C to F.) (25 points) 
4. Code with appropriate comments (20 points) 
5. Four screen shots showing the program works correctly. (20 points) 
6. 10 bonus points for using more than four functions (excluding main function) in the entire code.
